#  lifespan-ticks: 12000

#  This value represents the size of the Inventory of the chest. Modifying is strongly discouraged unless you know what you are doing.
#  crate-size: 45

#  Possible values: true OR false
#  msg-player: true

#  Possible values: true OR false
#  bc-msg: false

#  staff-perm: "deathchest.staff"

# ------------------------------    Messages Section    ------------------------------
# The prefix to use when sending messages:

# tpmsg-text: "&6TP to DeathChest`s location"

# This is the name to give to the crate. The following placeholders are supported:
# %plrnm% --> The name of the player who died
# More placeholders coming soon!
# crate-name: "&a%plrnm%`s DeathChest"

# This is the name to give to the hologram that appears above the chest. Same placeholders as above.

# This is the message that will be sent to the player who died. The following placeholders are supported:
# %plrnm% --> The name of the player who died
# %loc% --> The location of the crate in the following format: X:[x], Y:[y], Z: [z] {Placeholders %x%, %y% and %z% also supported}
# %time% --> The time, in minutes or seconds, that the player has until their deathchest is deleted.
# %tpmsg% --> clickable text that will teleport the player to their deathchests location.[WARNING: This module will output to the console when it is clicked. Do not use it to prevent console spam. Fix for this coming soon]
# player-message: "&eYour DeathChest has been placed. Hurry up, or it will be removed!"

# The message sent to players with the permission defined in config.yml. The following placeholders are supported:
# %plrnm% --> The name of the player who died

# %tpmsg% --> Clickable text that will teleport the player to their deathchests location.[WARNING: This module will output to the console when it is clicked. Do not use it to prevent console spam. Fix for this coming soon]
# staff-message:  "&e%plrnm%`s DeathChest was placed in %loc%. %tpmsg%"

# The message broadcasted to the entire server. The following placeholders are supported:
# %plrnm% --> The name of the player who died
# %loc% --> The location of the crate in the following format: X:[x], Y:[y], Z: [z] {Placeholders %x%, %y% and %z% also supported}
# %time% --> The time, in minutes or seconds, that the player has until their deathchest is deleted.

# message: %text% other text
# if TRUE output will be: %text% other text
# if FALSE output will be: other text
# keep-unknown-placeholders: false
